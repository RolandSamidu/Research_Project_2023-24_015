"Never pay from your credit card. The worst customer care in this place. If something happens with the payment they never resolve it. We have to do everything. They never accept their fault. There is no one to complain also, Owner or Manager is not in the shop or no supervisor or any one two complain the problems. My wife brought some medicine from this place and, sales women punch my wife credit card twice from there two card machines. But the receipt only comes from one machine. So my wife not checks it. But when we went home my wife saw that there is two transaction in same amount to Gagana pharmacy pannipitiya. So we called the Gagana pharmacy and told them that there is a two truncation for their pharmacy. They check it but said no there is only one transaction is done. So we went to our bank and update the book and went to the Gagana Pharmacy. In that time they called their boss and told the problem and call the bank that's mean when we called them they never check it. The payment is only for Rs. 590.00. When my wife in phone with their bank this sales girls saying this type of matters happens in every time with customers but this is only for Rs 590.00. They talk like we are just some kind of cheap persons. Rs. 590.00 are our money. Why we pay more money for them. Gagana Pamachy is a not a begging or charity company it‚Äôs a Profitable company. Then the owner came and willing to pay Rs 590.00 in cash. But I said I do not need your money call your bank and transfer it to our bank. Very Very Bad customer care service in this place. And never pay from your credit card on this place (sales girls saying this type of matters happens in every time).",3

"On 29th Aug 2020 at around 4: 30pm, i went to all the way to thalawathugoda Healthguard pharmacy to buy a Knee Stabilizer (oppo 1035) for my mother. I was searching this in many places but was nt available. My mother was seriously suffering as doctor advised to wear it when she is walking to avoid least the pain. My concern is this when i entered i spoke to one of staff with a beared n wearing a pink shirt (i guess he is the incharge may be). When i inquire and ask for it point blank without any interest to see even the stock with no interest whilst he was doing his work Said thts not available. Funny thing when i asked to check with other HG outlets he said no point as he its confired the stockes are not available. Finally with such dissapoint i was just walking in to display cabinet and accidentally noticed its available with exact number. Thn i spoke to another pharmacist and asked to check with my priscription. Je confirmed thts the same. Then i measure my mother thie size its exactly OK. I was so happy. That guy was hidden himself looking at me least never bother to appologise. Finally i tols hoa what i wanted is available though u said NO. PLS PAY YOUR ATTENTION SPECIALY IN YOUR BUSINESS. CAUSE WE ARE NOY WALKING IN TO FOOD CITY OR SUPERMARKETS. Understand your Job role and impotanace of your technical assistant for needy people. ATTENTION TO MANAGEMENT
***** Appreciate the quick response of HG unit incharge Ms. Oshini to acknowledge the genuine concern of regret and to assure not let any room to repeat such mistake with gross negligence.
Customer service is paramount

I was shocked to see the warfarin medicines, CIPLA brand (heart medication) that was home delivered for someone that I know with the expiry date after a month, Mar/2023 and was delivered on 20230118. So for 2 years 84 tablets in a box was collecting dust in a shelf somewhere in India before they got delivered to Sri Lanka to put people here at risk. Always check the manufacturing/expiry date on all the medicines that you buy online/offline in Sri Lanka. It looks like India is cleaning up its medicines close to the expiry date with the help of online pharmacies in Sri Lanka. Please beware everyone, thanks!",2
"Great and fast service‚Ä¶ I've been ordering medications from Canada to my mother who lives in Sri Lanka through Healthnet ‚Ä¶its next-level customer service‚Ä¶super fast delivery‚Ä¶ even during medication deficits in SL, Healthnet had all almost all the medicines‚Ä¶ it was so convenient‚Ä¶keep up the good work Healthnet. ‚Ä¶",5
"I ordered online my mom‚Äôs diabetes medications for 3 months and they initially issued a quotation including all drugs for 3 months and in next moment they sent me another quotation issuing the drugs only for 1 month. Explanation was their management has decided to provide only 1 month supply per customer due to current situation in the country.
What a bummer!",3
"During the lock down period, I was required to find some urgent medicine and the material was out of stock in almost all the Online Pharmacies. When I directly spoke to those shops, their response was negative and even when I said that I would pay extra to find it others were reluctant. In such a landscape HealthNet team figured out my requirement and got down the items without any additional charge. Also the lady at the customer service was extremely helpful in getting it down.",2
Best online medicine delivery service ever! Thank you healthnet for beign a very surpportive body to our busy lives! Top brand best quality medicine and the most excellent and the most friendliest customer service ever! Keep up your good work and i wish you to be in the top of the business/industry in the country!

Very rude. Stay away from the shop and let us show him the power of customers.",2
Was able to get Lumigan 0.01 from them. Seems to be well stocked. Would be nice if the shelves were properly arranged. That would enable customers to walk arround freely.,4
"The most unfriendly pharmacy I have come across so far. I was asked to come after 3 hours by the person at the counter informing me that the boss would be available by then to return my medicine with receipt. But when I returned back after 3 hours the ""boss"" completely refused to refund or exchange my medicine i purchased at this pharmacy. Unlike other pharmacies they do not even give 5% discount for cash purchases. This is the pharmacy I would advise everyone to avoid at any cost as they are really money minded despite making 40% nett profit from medicine sales.",2
They charge 3% extra for credit card payment. They should at least inform before they do his.list price was 6950/= ended up paying Rs 7125/=. The Difference is only Rs Rs 175 but still ther actions has prompted me not to patronize Raj Pharmacy anymore,3
"Naming it as Pharmacy is very unfair. It is by far a Minimart. Well organized business. In addition to pharmaceuticals, they have chocolates, biscuits, coffees, sweets other medical related equipment.",1
They said will deliver the meds but took more than a day. The patient could have died by the time they sent it. If delivery was not an option then dnt do it. I had to call more than 10 times. Worst customer service ever.,2
They have given me best hospitality and service they are doing their job well. They having all the medical items. They surgical masks and panadol too.,5
"Shockingly bad. Worse than any government office. My wife walked in to buy some pain relief balm, the only customer inside was seated and waiting and no one was being served at that moment. There were four staff members behind the counter with one male and three females. Despite my wife standing there no-one came to serve her, even when one staff member walked up-to her to talk to the customer behind her she refused to even look at my wife. My wife finally gave up and came back to the car and I went in, I went to the counter and had to talk loudly and call them, one girl reluctantly came to the counter and when I asked for the balm, she just went back to the group of people including the one male staff and they were all just grouped together giggling like school kids in a corner; including the man. This is so shockingly bad and unprofessional it doesn't feel real. How would these unprofessional staff manage to handle a customer who comes in with a serious requirement? These people aren't fit to work at a service that is considered essential; I honestly question if these people are even adults? The owner needs to have a look the CCTV footage if available and address the staff on how to behave at work. I was there sometime between 20: 35 and 20: 40 12th September 2023. These are the kind of people who end up running for government.",3
"They almost have anything and everything. Have parking too.
Very good service from most of them.",2

"Today I went and paid by card and got my medication, was about to leave when the lady who processed the payment ran out to the park and managed to stop me only to tell me they had charged me twice and apologized profusely. They compensated me for the overcharge and compensated instantly. It is amazing to see this level of honesty and integrity and I will keep coming back and recommend to everyone I know. Great attitude folks!
Not only do they have the medications that I need which aren't available in most other pharamcies in the area but they provide excellent customer service.",3
Asked for Vitamin C 500mg ones for 30 days. Earlier they used to send a chewable one this time it is not a chewable one and the price is high as well. They should at least ask about it before sending it out.,2
Thanks For the care taken when providing the medicine. Keep up the Good service.,4
"You will get most of required medicine even with large quantities, staffs seems well experienced or supported by experience staff. Medical equipments also available",2
They have posted its open until midnight but I went on Monday around 11.15 and they have been closed. There should be a consistency otherwise customers get lot along the way.,3

This place has almost all the type medicine which cant be found in other pharmacies,2
" It is open almost every day, they follow strict COVID guidelines. The staff is professional and well knowledgeable",5
The best place for all your medical needs. Prices are very reasonable and competitive.,2
People who are work there has to know that they have to give the service to the customers according to a line or who came first. I had had worst experience today. Suddenly somebody came accross me and talked to the pharmacist and suprisingly she responded him without considering me that already i came first. That is not a good ethic,4
"Completely Trustworthy and with Reasonable Prices.
They are honest, efficient, reasonable in cost and always provide great service!",2
Very dangerous pharmacy. If you buy drugs from there make sure to recheck the given drugs with the prescription. Since there are so many other pharmacies in Maharagama no need to put your life in danger.,3
Delivered all of the medicine I wanted during curfew with the delivery pass. All the employees were extremely polite and very friendly. Delivered to my grandmother and my place but only charged one delivery fee since both houses were in the same area. Highly recommend.,1
" Good honest and friendly service, from the fellows, that work at Asian Pharma!

I was expecting too be ripped off or short changed, like the rest of my experience in Colombo?

The chap even gave me a bit of a discount and the exact amount loose tabs in a bag. Also gave me critical advice about my medication - Well done!

"Very bad customer service. My mother has visited to get change the mg of her medicine which she has bought previous day. The person has shouted at her. She was very upset. Even if you refuse to change, there‚Äôs a way to communicate to an old lady. Think how you start the business. If you don‚Äôt have customers and don‚Äôt know how to retain them it will be a short term business.",2

"DO NOT BUY ANY ITEM FROM HERE. THEY ARE EXTRA CHARGING ON YOU. I have given a call to this pharmacy today morning and they informed me the price of a urine stripes for pregnancy test Rs 30/=.
Just to make confirm before go there my husband also called and they gave the same answer. But once I went their they charged Rs 50/= per stripe, which I bought 3 just because there was not any other place to buy, even though they CHEATED ME AND CHARGED EXTRA Rs 60/= for 3 stripes, but the ACTUAL PRICE SHOULD BE RS 90/= as per the information they gave us in the morning.
Once I questioned why they charged extra they said the price has gone up. Really within 1 hour you increased the price?
DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE BETTER TO FIND ANY OTHER PLACE, they are cheaters. And they DID NOT ISSUED A BILL FOR MY PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH I REQUESTED. BETTER TO AVOID THIS PLACE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.",3
