<b>Intro :</b> Heart diseases remain a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and prevention. In addressing this issue, a mobile application was developed with components focusing on predicting the risk of becoming a heart patient, predicting the risk category of a heart patient, food item identification and dietary recommendation, and suggesting best rated nearby pharmacies to fulfill a doctorâ€™s prescription. All these components include trained deep learning algorithms to assure a reliable performance within each component. In predicting the risk of becoming a heart patient, a trained logistic regression algorithm was used. As for predicting the risk category of a heart patient, a trained k-nearest neighbors algorithm was used. For the components of food item classification and suggesting best rated nearby pharmacies, YOLOv5 and TextBlob were utilized respectively. Results show that accuracies of the results from each component is significant enough for mass scale utilization of all the components of our mobile application in improving life standards of heart patients.

<h3>Methodology</h3>

Our team designed the mobile app for the convenience of heart patients and doctors focusing on risk assessment and control of heart disease. Here, the risk of a person becoming a heart patient can be found earlier. And a person who is at risk of heart disease should be advised to follow a diet. Another unique feature here is the ability to automatically analyze the ECG reports and predict the risk situations that he or she may face in the future by comparing them with the previously obtained reports. A patient can find the nearest pharmacy to get the prescription through this mobile application as well. The overall system diagram is shown in Fig. 1 and a brief description of the four main functional components is mentioned subsequently.
