This will be used to create a mobile application for heart patients for research project by our team, fourth year students. Here, mostly machine learning algorithms are used to create AI models.

<b>Intro :</b> Heart diseases remain a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and prevention. In addressing this issue, a mobile application was developed with components focusing on predicting the risk of becoming a heart patient, predicting the risk category of a heart patient, food item identification and dietary recommendation, and suggesting best rated nearby pharmacies to fulfill a doctorâ€™s prescription. All these components include trained deep learning algorithms to assure a reliable performance within each component. In predicting the risk of becoming a heart patient, a trained logistic regression algorithm was used. As for predicting the risk category of a heart patient, a trained k-nearest neighbors algorithm was used. For the components of food item classification and suggesting best rated nearby pharmacies, YOLOv5 and TextBlob were utilized respectively. Results show that accuracies of the results from each component is significant enough for mass scale utilization of all the components of our mobile application in improving life standards of heart patients.
